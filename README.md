## Projects

List some of your most significant or interesting projects with a brief description, links, and technologies used.

1. [Assemblage](https://github.com/AceLake/Assemblage-Flutter) - What Is Assemblage? The whole basis for the app is in Matthew 18:20 where we are called to assemble to rejoice in the presence of God. Assemblage is a platform used to bring people together to study God's word, not only to understand Him further but to strengthen our relationship with him while at the same time strengthening our relationship with the body of Christ. Everyone should be able to easily find and join a Bible study group.
   - Tech Stack: Dart, Flutter, Firebase

2. [Instagramp-2](https://github.com/AceLake/Instagramp-2) - In our Agile class, we were given the creative freedom to develop an application connected to a database, showcasing the complete set of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

   - Tech Stack: C#, .NET Core, MongoDB

2. [League of Legends Stats App](https://github.com/AceLake/League-Info-app) - I have developed a League of Legends Stats App that leverages Riot Games' APIs to retrieve and display specific information related to summoner profiles, including summoner names and ID numbers. This project is more of a proof of concept to showcase my knowledge in API integration and data retrieval.

   - Tech Stack: C#, .NET Core, Riot API

3. [Product Inventory CRUD Webapp](https://github.com/Longsleevesz/CST-339-asignment) - In this project, I worked with a team where we implemented REST services using SpringWeb, which was extremely useful and easy to display information for other applications to consume. I also used SpringData, which allowed me to seamlessly use MongoDB as the database. For the security side of things, I used SpringSecurity which is a powerful authentication and authorization framework. It enabled me to secure all pages of the site. To do so I ensured user authentication and took advantage of role-based access. Doing this made sure that the application remained protected against any unauthorized access.

   - Tech Stack: Java, Spring Boot, Thymeleaf

4. [Minesweeper Game Website](https://github.com/Jugooch/Milestone-CST350) - To develop this Minesweeper web application, I worked with a group using C# ASP.Net and Razor as the templating engine. Originally, we used a relational database but ended up using MongoDB to store game data and created the game's logic entirely in C#. We used HTML for displaying the game interface and implemented partial page updates using AJAX functionality for seamless mine sweeping. I designed a system to save game sessions as models and stored them to continue Later, retrieving them based on the user's ID. To ensure that the game is associated with the current user I maintained session states using cookies.

   - Tech Stack: C#, .NET Core, MongoDB  

5. [Bible Webapp](https://github.com/AceLake/BibleAppKJV) - Developing this project, I gained hands-on experience in developing a Bible Web application using C#, .NET Core, and SQL. I used an already-built database that held every verse of the Bible. With the data given, I implemented the functionality to search and retrieve specific verses.

   - Tech Stack: C#, .NET Core, SQL


## Experience

- [Alpine Landscaping and Design](https://www.alpinedesignsmt.com/) - Mower/Trimmer (May 2017 - July 2023)
  - I learned that when I commit to something I must follow through.

  - I learned to be adaptable. If the boss wanted me to mow I was a mower if they wanted me to landscape I was a landscaper. They say it I do it.

- [Mission Valley Christian Academy](https://mvcapolson.org/) - Volunteer Code Teacher (September 2019 - March 2020)
  - I tought grades 2nd - 6th Lessons through Code.org.
  - I learned how to learn the material and teach at the same time.

## Education

- [Grand Canyon University](https://www.gcu.edu/) - Bachelor of Science in Software Development (Graduating Late April 2023)
  - I have thoroughly enjoyed the full-stack nature of the curriculum, which has provided me with a solid understanding of software development.
